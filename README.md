# AI Failure Pattern Detector

This is a Python-based tool for identifying systematic failure patterns in outputs generated by large language models (LLMs). The goal is to support transparency, debugging, and evaluation of AI systems by flagging common issues in generated responses.

## Overview

LLMs often produce outputs that appear syntactically correct but contain subtle flaws. This tool is designed to automatically detect certain classes of failure, such as:

- Excessive numerical precision that suggests hallucination
- Redundant justifications or contradictions
- Overuse of qualifiers or hedges in factual answers
- Label/data mismatches in structured outputs (planned)

The current implementation focuses on **hallucinated numerical precision**, particularly in finance-related contexts.

## Files

- `detect_patterns.py` — the main Python script that parses a text file and scans for detectable issues  
- `sample_ai_output.txt` — an example file containing simulated model output for testing  
- `README.md` — project documentation  

## Usage

To run the detector, clone the repository and execute the script from the command line:

```bash
python detect_patterns.py
```

This assumes the working directory contains `sample_ai_output.txt`. You can modify the script to point to a different file or accept arguments.

## Goals

This repository is part of a larger initiative to build evaluation tools that:

- Help researchers and auditors detect reasoning flaws  
- Demonstrate how human oversight can scale with lightweight automation  
- Provide practical examples of Python scripting for AI debugging  

Future improvements may include a command-line interface, CSV output, or a web-based frontend.
